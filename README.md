# Chatbot Project üñ§
# Overview üëÄ
This is a Python-based chatbot project designed to create a conversational agent capable of assisting users with answering questions, providing recommendations. It aims to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system and obtaining relevant information or assistance.. The chatbot utilizes  libraries or frameworks such as NLTK, scikit-learn,streamlit,ssl etc. for natural language processing and conversation management.

Once deployed, users can interact with the chatbot by sending it multiple requests and the chatbot can handle the entire conversation itself. To create an end-to-end chatbot using Python, we can follow the steps mentioned below:

1.Define Intents

2.Create training data

3.Train the chatbot

4.Build the chatbot

5.Test the chatbot

6.Deploy the chatbot

# Functionality üöÄ
The chatbot is designed to:

Understand and interpret user queries using natural language processing techniques.

Recognize user intents and provide appropriate responses based on predefined scenarios.

Handle common conversational flows and guide users through interactions.

# Technologies Used ‚≠ê
Programming Language: Python

Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries: NLTK, spaCy

Machine Learning Framework: scikit-learn.

Chatbot Framework: Streamlit,ssl.

# Project Structure ü¶Å
The project consists of the following components:

Main Chatbot Module: Contains the core logic for processing user inputs, recognizing intents, and generating responses.

Data Preprocessing Module: Handles preprocessing of user input data for NLP tasks.

Intent Recognition Module: Implements machine learning models or rule-based systems for intent recognition, if applicable.

Response Generation Module: Generates appropriate responses based on recognized intents and context.

Configuration Files: Contains configuration settings and parameters for the chatbot.
